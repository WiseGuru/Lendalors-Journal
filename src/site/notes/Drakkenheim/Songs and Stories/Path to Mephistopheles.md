Through ruined temples, dank and musty
You shoulder on searching for your prize
Cross rotten pews, halls dark and dusty
Looking for a path to Mephistopheles

Stop, drop,
Go down, fleshy, go down
Stop, drop,
Go down, fleshy, go down
Looking for a path,
Looking for a path to Mephistopheles

Broken doors and burning candles
Light the way through jagged darkness
Archaic effects and forgotten sandals
Preserved corpses with saints' likeness

Stop, drop,
Go down, fleshy, go down
Stop, drop,
Go down, fleshy, go down
Looking for a path,
Looking for a path to Mephistopheles

Otherworldly winged beasts call to you
Abruptly halted, fear in your knees
Gnarled visage, long in claw and tooth
Shouts in the swirling dark; Mephit, stop please

Stop, drop,
Go down, fleshy, go down
Stop, drop,
Go down, fleshy, go down
Looking for a path,
Looking for a path to Mephistopheles
