[[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Lukrum Stormrock\|Lukrum Stormrock]] first told [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|me]] the story of the haunting of Eventide Manor, and wanted to give my own spin on the tale. 

In broad strokes, an elven woman named Elwyn was scorned or cheated on by her lover, and she murdered him, and now haunts the mansion, killing any who enter. Those who survive often have their hair all turned white.

[[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Lukrum Stormrock\|Lukrum]] said he sometimes changes the name depending on the audience, but for this version I'm going with Kieran, a strong elven name that suits the story, but will alternate his name with distant relatives of locals as I see fit.


### The Haunting of Eventide Manor

Gather round friends and let me tell you a story
Put the children abed, for it gets quite gory
It begins with love and ends with death;
It's a warning to all, so take a deep breath
and hear of the haunting Eventide Manor

Our tale begins with lovers two,
Hearts pierced by cupid's arrows, true
Kieran Eventide, a mage most powerful
And Elwyn, sweet Elwyn, a cleric most faithful
Together, forever, in Eventide Manor

Happily together they passed many years
Kieran consumed with the study of the spheres
And Elwyn was doting, patient and kind
But he lost his way, became spellblind
Not all was well in Eventide Manor

Lusting for power and novel experience
He brought to bed a pretty young tarriance
Elwyn discovered them in flagrante delicto
Buried to his hilt in her erotogenic zone
Furor-filled Elwyn of Eventide Manor

Enraged Elwyn slew them both
Cut them and chopped them for tainted troth
She decorated the house in crimson splendor
It took many more lives to at last apprehend her
The grisly slaughter at Eventide Manor

Poor, sweet Elwyn of Eventide Manor
Broken by the betrayal of a vile pretender
They hanged her in front to look on her work
But even in death, her duty she did not shirk
The dead shall keep Eventide Manor

Elwyn now walks those halls most dread
Thinking those who enter have tainted her bed
She butchers and slays all invaders
None who enter will ever evade her
The dead shall keep Eventide Manor

But for those with hearts set on riches
Who think love and remorse are just for bitches
They might be interested to know of the treasure
Accumulated over years of Elven measure^[Meaning years of elven life.]
Hidden deep within Elventide Manor

Gems and jewels, gold and platinum
Arcane artifacts and magic factotum
If your heart is of stone, cruel and cold
Perhaps you're enticed, clever and bold
You're not afraid of Eventide Manor

But for those who love, or value their life
And perhaps know of struggle and strife
They will leave Elwyn to mourn her fate
And think better than to take the bait
They should stay away from Eventide Manor

That is my story, vicious and true
Shake off your shivers and don't let'em stew
You're safe and sound with nothing to fear
So finish your ale and be of good cheer
But never forget the haunting of Eventide Manor
