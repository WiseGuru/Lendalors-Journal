[[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Lukrum Stormrock\|Lukrum Stormrock]] first told [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|me]] the story of the haunting of Eventide Manor, and wanted to give my own spin on the tale. 

In broad strokes, an elven woman named Elwyn was scorned or cheated on by her lover, and she murdered him, and now haunts the mansion, killing any who enter. Those who survive often have their hair all turned white.

[[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Lukrum Stormrock\|Lukrum]] said he sometimes changes the name depending on the audience, but for this version I'm going with Kieran, a strong elven name that suits the story, but will alternate his name with distant relatives of locals as I see fit.


### The Haunting of Eventide Manor

Gather round, friends, I'll tell you a tale;
Send the children to bed for this dark regale.
It starts with love and ends in death,  
A tale so grim, it chills your breath,  
And listen well to Eventide Manor.

Our story begins with lovers, two,  
Their hearts pierced by Cupid's arrows, true.  
Kieran Eventide, a mage of might,  
And Elwyn, fair Elwyn, a cleric of light,  
Together forever in Eventide Manor.

For years, they dwelled in peaceful bliss,  
Kieran lost in the stars' abyss.  
Elwyn was patient, loving, and kind,  
But Kieran lost his way, became spellblind,  
All was not well in Eventide Manor.

He lusted for power, for knowledge anew,  
And took to his bed a lover untrue.  
Elwyn caught them, entangled as one,  
In rage, she struck until they were done—  
The fateful fury of Eventide Manor.

With blade and bludgeon she slashed and slew,  
None could stop what would ensue
She painted the walls with crimson splendor,
With the blood of those sent to apprehend her
The grisly tale of Eventide Manor.

Poor Elwyn, now lost to despair,  
Betrayed by love, beyond repair.  
They hanged her high to face her own wrath,  
But even in death, she walks her dark path,  
Guarding the halls of Eventide Manor.

Now Elwyn stalks, with vengeance unfed,  
Believing each intruder defiles her bed.  
She butchers and slays all who invade,  
None who enter will ever evade—  
The cursed keeper of Eventide Manor.

Yet some, with hearts of greed and stone,  
May seek the treasure she guards alone—  
Ancient riches and artifacts grand,  
Gathered over years by elven hand,  
Hidden deep within Eventide Manor.

If your heart is cruel, bold, and cold,  
Perhaps you'll seek the wealth untold.  
But those who cherish love or grace,  
Would spare her soul and leave this place,  
And stay far from Eventide Manor.

So heed my story, vicious and true,  
Shake off the shivers that cling to you.  
You’re safe for now, with nothing to fear,  
Finish your ale, and be of good cheer,  
But never forget the haunting of Eventide Manor.
