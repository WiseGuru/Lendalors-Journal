Original song from Lendalor, from [[Drakkenheim/_Sessions/S3 - Pickled and Roasted\|S3 - Pickled and Roasted]]

Through ruined temples, dank and musty
You shoulder on searching for your prize
Cross rotten pews, halls dark and dusty
Looking for a path to Mephistopheles

Stop, drop,
Go down, fleshy go down
Go down, fleshy, go down

Broken doors and burning candles
Light the way through jagged darkness
Archaic effects and forgotten sandals
Preserved corpses with saints' likeness

Stop, drop,
Go down, fleshy go down
Go down, fleshy, go down

Otherworldly winged beasts call to you
Abruptly halted, fear in your knees
Gnarled visage, long in claw and tooth
Shouts in the swirling dark; Mephit, stop please

Stop, drop,
Go down, fleshy go down
Go down, fleshy, go down

Go down, fleshy go down
Go down, fleshy, go down
