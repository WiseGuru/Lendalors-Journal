# S8 - Winnie the Doge

[[Drakkenheim/_Sessions/Missions\|Our current missions.]]

## Session Summary

1. We move along, and find a well trained hunting dog called Winnie
2. [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]] turns into a noble dog, and converses with our new friend, and we decide to help it find its master!
	1. We move along, and come across a small square filled with [[Drakkenheim/Creatures/Delirium Dregs\|Delirium Dregs]]
3. Fight!
	1. [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] casts Darkness on [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Dolgroth\|Dolgroth]], and we sneak into their midst
	2. But we trip up a little, and we go at it!
	3. The [[Drakkenheim/Creatures/Delirium Dregs\|Dregs]] are far more sophisticated than basic [[Drakkenheim/Creatures/Haze Husk\|husks]]
		1. One of them is able to cast spells, and other use bone spears and weapons, and coordinate and speak!
		2. One of them, a former bard or musician, even sends out this infectious laughter that numbs the mind
	4. We quickly defeat them (mostly thanks to [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] and his fiery magic), though not without injury
4. [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|I]] revive the downed dog master, and we are introduced to him
	1. He is a goliath named [[Houndmaster\|Houndmaster]], and he works for a man named [[Jim Foreign\|Jim Foreign]]...
