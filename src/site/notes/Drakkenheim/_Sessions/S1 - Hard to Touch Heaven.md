#Session_Drakk

## Summary


1. The party assembles, and we decide the best way to enter Drakkenheim is through the Shephard’s Gate, which is controlled by the Drakkenguard.
	1. There are other gates, but they range from “dangerous” to “eldritch horror”
	2. [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|Lendalor]] spent the better part of a week interviewing residents and travelers of [[Drakkenheim/Locations/Emberwood\|Emberwood]], recording their stories of the fall of Drakkenheim
2. [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] knows a Ms. [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Ophelia\|Ophelia]] of the Drakkenguard, and she offers us an exchange
	1. The safe return of an artifact from the [[Drakkenheim/Locations/Chapel of the Sacred Flame\|Chapel of the Sacred Flame]] for safe passage into the Drakkenheim
		1. [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Sir Bryce Landry]] is already at the Chapel, but he is a novice knight, and needs help probably
	2. We buy some health potions and go on our way
3. En Route to the chapel, we encounter two strange buildings
	1. A derelict watchtower
		1. Inside are between 6 and 10 “Haze husks,” zombie like manifestations of the Haze, crowded around a dead body
		2. [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] and [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] use their mastery of illusion magic to distract the Husks, and [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|Lendalor]] uses a cheap trick to fly over and examine the body
			1. Belonged to a Queen’s Men soldier, but it’s pretty mangled
			2. Holds a single sheet of paper in its case with only four words discernable. “Statue… immovable rod… underground”
	2. An abandoned store - “[[Drakkenheim/Locations/Meridian Imports\|Meridian Imports]]”
		1. A group of adventurers (orc, giant (?), halfling, human (?), and a mastiff) tried to hide some chips of delirium in the basement
		2. We found it, took it, and ran into them on the way out
			1. We convinced them that a group of elves were here first, and if they hurry they just might catch them!
			2. This probably won’t bite us sometime in the future.
4. We reach the [[Drakkenheim/Locations/Chapel of the Sacred Flame\|Chapel of the Sacred Flame]]
	1. There is a statue to Saint Vetruvio out front holding two huge rods
		1. [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|Lendalor]] mouthed along “statue… immovable rod… underground”
	2. We meet Sir Landry and his 4 squires
		1. We decide to enter from the front and they will circle around the back (MAX: I think, I’m not entirely certain what the plan is)
		2. There’s a group of Queen’s Men on the other side of the chapel
			1. The Queen’s Men are little more than a bandit gang, and are actively desecrating the church
	3. The Chapel is a sacred site and we are explicitly instructed “NO LOOTING OF THE SACRED SITE”
		1. [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|Lendalor]] whole-heartedly agrees
		2. It is [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]]’s **ONLY JOB** to steal as **MUCH AS SHE CAN CARRY** from the chapel
