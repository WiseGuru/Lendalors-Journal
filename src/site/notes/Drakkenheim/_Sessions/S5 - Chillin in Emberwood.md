Off to the side, I spot a small stall with just a man and a chest

[[Drakkenheim/_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]], being the very capable fence and merchant she is, handled the sale of all the gear we collected, and we bought a couple health potions from [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Aldor the Immense\|Aldor]]. I tried to haggle him down a little, but instead he STARED INTO MY SOUL, and I don't know how I feel about that.

I asked around to learn about the various groups, and learned about the thugs whose cache we raided in [[Drakkenheim/_Sessions/S1 - Follow the Octarine Brick Road\|S1]]
- [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Blackjack Mel\|Blackjack Mel]] is a member of [[Drakkenheim/Factions/The Queen's Men\|The Queen's Men]], and he hangs around the [[Drakkenheim/Locations/Emberwood\|Bark and Buzzard]]

[[Drakkenheim/_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] dipped out of view, and later we found out he checked in to his home at [[Drakkenheim/Locations/Emberwood\|Eventide Manner]].

[[Drakkenheim/_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] went to speak with her parents, who are very cute and sweet. Also, [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] has a brother named Kevin who's been brainwashed by thugs?!?

Once the day was done, we all had a slumber party at [[Drakkenheim/Locations/Emberwood\|Eventide Manner]] and [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] made pancakes in the morning. I wrote a short update to [[Drakkenheim/Factions/The Pail Sifter\|The Pail Sifter]] and sent it on its way.

[[Drakkenheim/_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] and [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]] are approached by a man in a green hood, [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Ansem Lang\|Ansem Lang]], who informed them that his sister [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Petra Lang\|Petra Lang]] was kidnapped by [[Drakkenheim/Creatures/Ratlings\|Ratlings]]
- it's about 3 miles out of [[Drakkenheim/Locations/Emberwood\|Emberwood]], but we should be able to get there today

We embarked on our quest to rescue [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Petra Lang\|Petra Lang]]!
- We first encountered a female gnome member of [[Drakkenheim/Factions/The Amethyst Academy\|The Amethyst Academy]], and after some cautious exchanges of the Message spell, we discovered she is my old friend [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Rehani Miblepeble\|Rehani Miblepeble]]!
	- Always a much better student than me, no doubt she's doing well in [[Drakkenheim/Factions/The Amethyst Academy\|The Amethyst Academy]].
	- When she learned we're headed to the [[Drakkenheim/Locations/Rat's Nest Tavern\|Rat's Nest Tavern]], she offered us 1200GP for a crystal of [[Drakkenheim/Artifacts and Mythic Items/Delirium\|Delirium]]that's rumored to be there.
	- She's staying at [[Drakkenheim/Locations/Emberwood\|The Red Line Inn]], and we can meet up with her there to trade.
- [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]] observes this crazy balista-looking thing, and it's a crazy-dangerous gnome contraption; an [[Drakkenheim/Artifacts and Mythic Items/Oaken Bolter\|Oaken Bolter]]
