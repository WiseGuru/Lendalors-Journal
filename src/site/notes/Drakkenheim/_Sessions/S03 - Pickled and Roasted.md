## Session Summary
1. Wrapping up last time...
	1. [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]] was successfully able to enter the basement, but did not get to investigate too much
	2. [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Sir Bryce Landry]] was **VERY** observant and called out [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] for sneaking the immovable rod
	3. [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Bryce]] shares how they learned the [[Drakkenheim/Artifacts and Mythic Items/The Scepter of Saint Vitruvio\|The Scepter of Saint Vitruvio]] was here
		1. Adventurers sent letters to [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/High Flame Keeper Ophelia Reed\|Ophelia]] leading to this ruin
			1. Our goal is to recover the scepter before it could be stolen by thugs
			2. A scout came out to inspect the area, and gave them word about the strange word about the rod
			3. [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Bryce]] reveals that the Immovable Rod is a key to entering
2. We descended into the basement, and decided to explore as a group rather than split up
	1. We first enter the eastern chamber, where voices could be heard, and find several greedy mephits looking for a pay day!
		1. These mephits are strange, elemental, winged goblins, that have a tendency to explode when they die
		2. [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] recognized them, but I'd never seen such unusual creatures.
		3. They breath scalding steam and blow blinding dust, and the magma mephit **ROASTED** [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Bryce]], and in his own temple!
			1. Like, really seriously roasted, and blinded too, really bad
	2. There was much fighting, and the mephits were unusually dexterous and nimbly avoided our attacks
		1. While I spent much of my time healing and reviving my comrades, [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]], [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]], and [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]] all did their best to slay the beasts
			1. [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Bryce]] mostly burned and bemoaned his blurry vision
		2. I VALIANTLY joined the fray, sticking a steamy stooge in the stomach!
		3. After much fighting, the other guards **FINALLY** finished their smoke break and sauntered in to join the fight
			1. The first guard *HEROICLY* stole the kill from [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] and [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]], only to immediately be blinded when it exploded in his face
	3. When all the enemies lay slain, I rushed to [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Bryce]]'s side and provided him with healing potions, and cured [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]] of some of his wounds
3. After the fight, [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Sir Bryce Landry]] took a seat and told us the story of the [[Drakkenheim/Artifacts and Mythic Items/The Scepter of Saint Vitruvio\|The Scepter of Saint Vitruvio]]
	1. It's a broken chari leg that was used to beat the crap out of some evil doers
	2. Not only was it held by [[Drakkenheim/Mythological Figures/Saint Vitruvio\|Saint Vitruvio]], but also by one of the high priestesses of the [[Drakkenheim/Factions/The Faith of the Sacred Flame\|The Faith of the Sacred Flame]]
	3. It's part of a collection of artifacts called [[Drakkenheim/Artifacts and Mythic Items/The Relics of Saint Vitruvio\|The Relics of Saint Vitruvio]]
		1. Others include his [[Phylactery of Saint Vitruvio\|Phylactery of Saint Vitruvio]] and [[Saint Vitruvio's Helm of Patron Saints\|Saint Vitruvio's Helm of Patron Saints]]
	4. Overcome with zealous rage, [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Bryce]] urged us on to continue the search for the [[Drakkenheim/Artifacts and Mythic Items/The Scepter of Saint Vitruvio\|Scepter]]...
		1. Hint: We probably should have taken a breather.
4. Rites of [[Drakkenheim/Factions/The Faith of the Sacred Flame\|The Faith of the Sacred Flame]]
	1. The [[Drakkenheim/Factions/The Faith of the Sacred Flame\|Sacred Flame]] treats the remains of dead clerics and paladins as holy relics, and take great pains to preserve and protect them
		1. The believe that one day, the souls might require their bodies again, and so choose to preserve them than cremate.
		2. The candles hold back any evil that would resurrect the dead
	2. There is a very special ritual of cleansing they perform on the dead, and I took very good notes
		1. The first shows the body being prepared: one priest washes the body, another wraps it in linens, the last collects the paladinâ€™s weapon, shield, and helm.
		2. The second mural shows two priests placing the body on a tomb slab, while the third places a holy symbol in its hands and a gemstone upon each eyelid. 
		3. In the third mural, the priests anoint the body with holy water or sacred oils. 
		4. In the fourth mural, the priests place and light the candles around the body. 
		5. The final mural shows one priest reading from a scroll while the others join hands and recite a hymn while standing beside the body.
	3. We also discover a chamber with a tree and leaves, that appears to be right under the statue of [[Drakkenheim/Mythological Figures/Saint Brenna\|Saint Brenna]]
5. With the choice of a northern or southern stairwell, we choose to go south and enter the sub-basement
	1. We enter a heigh-ceilinged crypt, with skeletons of the sacred dead lying on their sarcophagi 
		1. It doesn't look like all the preservation techniques of the [[Drakkenheim/Factions/The Faith of the Sacred Flame\|Sacred Flame]] are super effective... I think a salt brine would be better.
	2. We follow down a passageway, and encounter a completely smooth stone door
		1. One by one, we each investigate the door and discover that this is... a door
			1. It is also thick.
			2. And heavy.
		2. [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]], however, was more clever and observed that the door was linked to the rest of the immovable rod system
		3. Bryce helps us to lift the gate
	3. We find a special grave-site, for [[Drakkenheim/Mythological Figures/Saint Brenna\|Saint Brenna]] herself
		1. However, it is empty, with several of the candles snuffed by water which had dripped from above
		2. There are footprints that wandered the chamber and passed beyond another sealed stone door
			1. From within, we hear Bryce screaming...
6. We ran back to the main chambers, reset the door mechanism from the soiled and trembling soldier, and descend to find [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Bryce]] locked in combat with the desecrated remains of [[Drakkenheim/Mythological Figures/Saint Brenna\|Saint Brenna]]
	1. they are in a small chamber with the preserved remains of 6 holy warriors
		1. Two are holding magical artifacts; a glowing celestial greatsword, a shield and helm
	2. Two of Bryce's soldiers are dead, one is alive
	3. Even as it seems that we have arrived in the nick of time, it is unclear to me if we were still too late...




NOTE TO SELF: Must [[Drakkenheim/Songs and Stories/Path to Mephistopheles\|write a song with "Go down fleshy" in it...]]
