# S7 - Dolgroth The Buoyant

[[Drakkenheim/_Sessions/Missions\|Our current missions.]]

## Session Summary
1. [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Dolgroth\|Dolgroth]] the... shiny? Buoyant? Levitating?
	1. Clearly evil, wants to kill everyone.
	2. [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] discerns that he's likely a [Demilich](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Demilich), a failed attempt by a wizard or sorcerer at turning into a lich
	3. We negotiate a *dicey* truce while we navigate the remainder of the caves
		1. [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|I]] stick a holy-water vial attached to a pull-string into his noggin, so if he gets abrasive we can just let it rip
		2. He acts as a *familiar* [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]] while in our company
	4. [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Dolgroth\|He]] leads us back to the campfire, where we turn north
	5. While we adventure, I recount the story of [[Drakkenheim/Songs and Stories/Elwyn of Eventide Manor\|Elwyn of Eventide Manor]]
2. We disentangle ourselves from the [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Rat Prince\|Rat Prince]]
	1. We sneak up and discover the rats laying in ambush
	2. In a moment of inspiration, [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|I]] (with no small help from [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Dolgroth\|Dolgroth]]) convince them that we are emissaries of their god!
		1. We have been tasked with inspecting their offering's to the spiders
		2. The *[[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Rat Prince\|Rat Prince]]* is a crude and grovely creature, and thinks primarily of food, but holds great reverence for the rat gods.
	3. We snake away their things, complete our inspection, and then back-track our way out of the sewers and into the fresh air of [[Drakkenheim/Locations/Landmarks/The Sprawl\|The Sprawl]]
3. We take [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Petra Lang\|Petra]] to Shepherd's Gate
	1. She puts in a good word for us with [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Elias Drexel\|Elias Drexel]], head of [[Drakkenheim/Factions/The Hooded Lanterns\|The Hooded Lanterns]]
	2. She negotiates to give us 2x50' Hemp Rope, Potion of Heroism, 3x Healing Potion (2d4+2)
4. After this, we're heading to [[Drakkenheim/Factions/The Drakken Guard\|The Drakken Guard]], and then returning to [[Drakkenheim/Locations/Emberwood\|Emberwood]]!
