# S12 - 

[[Drakkenheim/_Sessions/Missions\|Our current missions.]]

## Session Summary
Turns out [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] actually grew up around here in Southward!
1. As we're travelling towards the [[Drakkenheim/Locations/Landmarks/Black Ivory Inn\|Black Ivory Inn]], [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|I]] keep my eyes peeled for pieces of [[Drakkenheim/Artifacts and Mythic Items/Delirium\|Delirium]]
	1. The proximity to the crash sit must be playing with my eyes... I can see pieces, but then I blink and it's gone.
2. We encounter a hulking [[Drakkenheim/Creatures/Haze Husk\|Haze Husk]] carrying a large chunk of [[Drakkenheim/Artifacts and Mythic Items/Delirium\|Delirium]] in a metal cage
	1. After much debate, we go at it with a powerful opening volley
		1. [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] hurls blasts of eldritch power at it, but misses
		2. [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]] summons a great storm, covering the road and striking it with powerful lightning blasts
		3. [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] casts "Mind Sliver", inflicting psychic damage
		4. [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|I]] call it an idiot.
	2. The fight is on!
		1. I cast Heat Metal on the cage of [[Drakkenheim/Artifacts and Mythic Items/Delirium\|Delirium]], but strangely, the spell doesn't take effect...
			1. The spell rebounds, and I am made invisible! 
		2. After much fighting, it's [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]]'s armor which deals the final blow
3. We cross a bridge, and on it, discover horrors.
	1. The bridge itself pulses, throbs; it is alive
	2. We each see horrors from our past
		1. [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|I]] see my mother, singing a song to me, but then warped to cast me into fear
		2. I don't know what the others saw, but [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] was drawn towards the wall, and [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] attacked it with magic
	3. We get through, but as we depart, a remnant, an echo of [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] calls out, distorted, and sinks into the ground
4. As we reach the [[King's Gate\|King's Gate]], we see it is fortified with trolls
	1. The [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Rat Prince\|Rat Prince]] meets us, and offers us safe passage across the wall
	2. He gives us [[Drakkenheim/Factions/The Hooded Lanterns\|Hooded Lantern]] cloaks, and at the end, demands payment
		1. 5 rations or a sharp or a shiny!
		2. [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] gives him 5 rations
5. As we approach the [[Drakkenheim/Locations/Landmarks/Black Ivory Inn\|Black Ivory Inn]], we hear music and see the ground is covered in lush grass, and the trees are plump with leaves
	1. [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] sneaks up and spots [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Kevin Ewidlyr\|Kevin Ewidlyr]]!
		1. We discuss what to do, and decide to walk in and talk with him
	2. A couple of observations as we walk in
		1. Many people of different factions, all hanging out
		2. No one objects to [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]]'s meat puppet
		3. The music is being played by an amazing musician named [[Miss Charlotte\|Miss Charlotte]]
			1. Child prodigy, untaught, one of the best (if not THE best) pianists in the world.
	3. I walk up to [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Kevin Ewidlyr\|Kevin Ewidlyr]] at the bar and try to start a conversation with him, but he is not picking up what I'm putting down.
		1. Doesn't get a rise out of anything, no major interaction, even when I mention [[Drakkenheim/Mythological Figures/The Queen of Thieves\|The Queen of Thieves]]
		2. [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] comes up and sits next to us, and he turns to face her, but doesn't recognize her.
