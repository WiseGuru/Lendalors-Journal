- A talking skull with [[Drakkenheim/Artifacts and Mythic Items/Delirium\|Delirium]] crystals for eyes!
- Very definitely evil. Wants to kill everyone and everything.
- Can't remember who it is; however, [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] believes it's likely a [Demilich](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Demilich), a failed attempt by a wizard or sorcerer at turning into a lich
- Right now, it has deigned to perform as [[Drakkenheim/_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]]'s familiar, and has a vial of holy water stuck in it's noggin attached to a rip-cord
- According to [[Drakkenheim/NPCs/Rehani Miblepebble\|Rehani Miblepebble]], he used to be in the "possession" of [[Drakkenheim/Factions/The Amethyst Academy\|The Amethyst Academy]]
	- He was kept in the "Inscrutable Tower," and was *one the most dangerous entities imprisoned there*
