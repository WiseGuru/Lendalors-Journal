The orc pantheon is the orcish interpretation of the *Outsiders*, evil pseudo-gods that are the embodiment of concepts like [[Entropus\|chaos]], [[Radsla\|fear]], [[Drakkenheim/Mythological Figures/Infirmum\|disease]], [[Telis\|undeath]], [[Nimic\|hate]], and [[Hadnost\|greed]].

However, instead of worshipping these entities in a traditional way, they *Endure* them through trials and challenges. Enduring the tests of the Outsiders is something that many orc tribes seek to do. If you can endure your biggest fear, or give away all possessions, or survive a disease, etc., then you are considered enlightened or ascendant. 

The harder the test, the more fame you have to win or lose

[[Drakkenheim/Mythological Figures/Luthic\|Luthic]] is the one orcish god who stands out from the rest; she is a *Divine (true) God* of *healing*, and has a complicated relationship with the rest of the pantheon.
