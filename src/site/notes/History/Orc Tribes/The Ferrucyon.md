The Ferrucyon were always at a disadvantage compared to the other groups; they were physically smaller, a little weaker, and reproduced slower. So as a group, they tended to be a little more diplomatic/sneaky/round-about in their problem-solving than the Helianthus or Danaus. Sometimes they would pit the two groups together if they were caught in the middle of a struggle, other times they would over-indulge their competitors with alcohol on the night of a competition, that sort of thing. What to the Ferrucyon was often stories of wit and cleverness, were retold by the Helianthus and Danaus as the stories of tricksters, distrust, betrayal, etc. The Ferrucyon was slowly diminished as a group, though they interbred/intermingled with the other groups, and their traditions sometimes live on under the radar. 

They are called a "Domarpak" as a kind of insult (I can't remember how I came up with this word)
