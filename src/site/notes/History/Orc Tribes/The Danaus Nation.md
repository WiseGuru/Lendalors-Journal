The Danaus Nation, the 2nd largest organized group of Orcs is named after the Monarch Butterfly, which they use for much symbology. They say that if such a small, fragile bug can migrate from one end of the world to another in one piece, so too can they test their will against the gods.They value resilience above all else. 

They have a different type of "worship". Partly inspired by the mountain folk in CoS, they see the Outsider Gods as ways to test their fortitude against greed, hate, fear, disease, necromancy. 

For example, a Danaus Orc would give up all possessions for a year or more to show greed has no hold on them. They would seek out the God of hate to infuse them with everlasting rage to prove they could temper it.
