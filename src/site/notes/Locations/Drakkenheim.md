## More Correct History of Drakkenheim
### **The Rise of Drakkenheim**

In the early days of Delmarva's exploration, this rugged continent was home to many dangers, but it was also a land of great magic. Ancient forests teemed with mystical creatures, and arcane energies flowed like rivers. Delmarva was a place of both healing and peril, where those seeking its magical bounty were as likely to be mended as maimed by the land's otherworldly forces.

It was against this backdrop that the Drakken Guard, an order of skilled elves and humans, emerged. Their primary duty was to protect the world from the creatures that lurked beyond Delmarva's shores. As Delmarva became more well-known, it attracted people from far and wide, both those seeking its magic for good and those with darker intentions.

### **The Founding of Drakkenheim**

As explorers and settlers came to Delmarva, they found the land inhospitable and harsh. It was the Drakken Guard who offered protection and sanctuary within the walls of a burgeoning city, which they named Drakkenheim. Over time, Drakkenheim grew into a thriving metropolis, and it was unique in its relationship with the ancient order. [[Factions/The Drakken Guard\|The Drakken Guard]] began to focus not only on protecting the continent but also on healing those who were beyond the abilities of common healers.

As the city prospered, it attracted powerful wizards, scholars, and adventurers. Drakkenheim soon became a center of magical learning and research. [[Factions/The Amethyst Academy\|The Amethyst Academy]] was founded, dedicated to the study of abjuration, enchantment, and divination, and it attracted some of the brightest minds from across the realms.

### **The Reign of the Von Kessels**

Drakkenheim's history took a significant turn when the Von Kessel family rose to power. Led by King Ulrich and Queen Lenore, they were beloved by the people and strengthened the kingdom's ties to other realms through trade and diplomacy. King Ulrich, in particular, was known for his wisdom and vision.

The Von Kessels had three children: Leonard, Katarina, and Eliza. Their family was related to the first human who joined the Drakken Guard, solidifying their connection to the order. Drakkenheim's prosperity continued under their rule, and it became a beacon of civilization in the otherwise untamed continent of Delmarva.

### **The Catastrophe**

Then came the night that forever changed Drakkenheim's fate. An explosion of eldritch fire erupted within the city, bathing it in a sickly and ominous light. The cataclysmic event tore through the very heart of Drakkenheim, causing devastation beyond measure. Families were torn asunder, the kingdom shattered, and the once-majestic city was reduced to ruins.

The explosion had a far-reaching impact. Monsters and abominations now stalked the haunted streets of Drakkenheim. Rival factions emerged from the ashes, each vying for control over the city's few remaining resources and the dark secrets hidden within its crumbling walls.

### **The Legacy Continues**

Fifteen years after the catastrophe, Drakkenheim is a city in ruins, its former glory but a distant memory. The factions that emerged from the chaos now vie for control, and adventurers from near and far are drawn to the haunted streets in search of riches, renown, and revenge.

  

## **The Gnomes and Hobgoblins: An Unlikely Alliance**

The emergence of the gnomes from the Feywild and their alliance with the enigmatic hobgoblins five years before the fall of Drakkenheim marked a significant cultural shift in the city's history.

### 

### **Gnomes' Exodus from the Feywild**

For years, the gnomes of the Feywild had been caught in the throes of a brutal war. Their once-vibrant homeland, known for its whimsical beauty and ethereal landscapes, had become a battleground where chaos reigned. Their feywild captors, known as the Glowborne and Dusklords, relentlessly pursued the gnomes, seeking to capture and return them to the tumultuous and dangerous Feywild.

The gnomes yearned for freedom, a respite from the ceaseless conflict that had plagued their existence. They saw in Drakkenheim a glimmer of hope, a sanctuary where they could escape the clutches of their pursuers and build a new life.

### **The Hobgoblins' Enigmatic Arrival**

Simultaneously, a mysterious race known as the hobgoblins appeared on the scene. Little was known about their origins, and they brought an air of enigma with them. What was clear, however, was their formidable strength and unwavering tenacity. They were fierce warriors, disciplined and resolute.

The hobgoblins, for reasons known only to them, took it upon themselves to protect the gnomes from the relentless pursuit of the Glowborne and Dusklords. They became a shield against the darkness of the Feywild, using their might and cunning to thwart the fey bounty hunters' attempts to capture the gnomes.

### **A Shared Goal in Drakkenheim**

The unlikely alliance between the gnomes and hobgoblins deepened with time. As the gnomes found safety and refuge in Drakkenheim, they began to adapt to their new home, contributing their own unique skills and talents to the city's diverse tapestry. The hobgoblins, too, integrated into the city, using it as a place to adjust to a world that was foreign to them.

When Drakkenheim fell into ruin, the gnomes and hobgoblins found themselves united by a shared sense of purpose. They had not forgotten the protection and sanctuary they had provided each other during the dark days of the Feywild. Now, their goal was clear: to help reclaim the city they had come to love and that had offered them a chance at a new life.
