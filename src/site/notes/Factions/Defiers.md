- Ranks
	- *Dissenters*
		- A Dissenter is someone who has undergone and overcome a challenge by each of the 6 gods. Dissenters are what most members of The Danaus Nation aspire to be.
	- *Heretics*
		- A Heretic is more rare than Dissenter. Heretics are roughly equivalent to priests in other religions. These are Danaus that have sought out one of the gods aspects, challenged it, and succeeded.
	- *Iconoclasts*
		- An Iconoclast is the most rare of the Danaus Nation. One cannot always ascend to this rank by just working towards it, rather they are “Curse-Marked”. A Curse-Marked is someone with an unholy investment of one of the gods.
