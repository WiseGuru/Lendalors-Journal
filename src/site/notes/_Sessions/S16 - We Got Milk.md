# S16 - Ringleaders

[[_Sessions/Missions\|Our current missions.]]

## Session Summary
1. We get the rules for the match!
	1. We're told not to use poison; if we're caught using it, we'll be forced to drink it
		1. Maybe I can fake dousing my weapon in a health potion if I get injured... 
	2. Since [[_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]] is still with [[Mythological Figures/The Queen of Thieves\|The Queen of Thieves]], [[_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] convinces the other team to go no-pets, and 3 v 3
		1. [[NPCs/Dolgroth\|Dolgroth]] is upset he's called a "Pet," but I tell him it stands for "Powerfully Evil Troublemaker"^[This doesn't calm him down, but I think it's funny.]
2. Let the fight begin!
	1. We come in HOT at the start, getting in a couple good hits on [[Gunog\|Gunog]]
		1. We learn that people with [[Creatures/Spine Worm\|Spine Worm]]s might not be susceptible to charm
		2. [[NPCs/Kreya\|Kreya]] (the orc with the [[Creatures/Spine Worm\|Spine Worm]]) charges me and wacks me good with her sword
			1. Then she whips her "cape" around and it sticks me with a little spike!
		3. [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] and Gunog are locked in combat, darting in and out of range!
	2. We clean house, and here are the highlights
		1. [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] wins the title of MVP with a Flaming Sphere, chasing our foes around the field while dancing blades with Gurog
			1. She also casts an illusion such that the boundary looked further away
			2. Seriously wounded, [[NPCs/Kreya\|Kreya]] charged me, overshot, and went out of bounds.
		2. [[_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] shot Scorching Ray into each of them
		3. [[_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|I]] looked dashing, hurled an oil flask at the burning Mirabelle, and viciously mocked Gorug
3. [[NPCs/Kreya\|Kreya]] asks about my jarred symbiote, but we agree to meet at [[Smee's Palace\|Smee's Palace]] before we leave
4. [[NPCs/Kevin Ewidlyr\|Kevin Ewidlyr]] has a little heart-to-heart with [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]]
5. A [[Mythological Figures/The Queen of Thieves\|mysterious stranger]] was watching us while we fought, and was waiting for us in the lobby of a building
	1. She appears as a human, but shifts her appearance to look like [[NPCs/Kevin Ewidlyr\|Kevin Ewidlyr]], and [[Luna\|Luna]] from [[_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]]'s past, and indicates that [[_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]] is safe, and changes into the shapes of my parents
	2. She says that if we can return a crest that [[NPCs/Kevin Ewidlyr\|Kevin Ewidlyr]] stole from her and then lost it, all of [[_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]]'s debts will be repaid. 
	3. [[The Crest\|The Crest]] is in the inner city, a place [[NPCs/Kevin Ewidlyr\|Kevin Ewidlyr]] would rather work of his debt for the rest of his life than return to. So, a nice place for a picnic!
