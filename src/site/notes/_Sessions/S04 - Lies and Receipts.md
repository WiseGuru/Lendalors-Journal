## Session Summary
1. Where were we...
	1. We had just managed to get downstairs, past a cowardly guard, and found [[NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Sir Bryce Landry]] locked in combat with the mummified remains of [[Mythological Figures/Saint Brenna\|Saint Brenna]]!
2. Fight!
	1. [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] jumps to [[NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Bryce]]'s rescue, and attempts to unwrap the mummy of [[Mythological Figures/Saint Brenna\|Saint Brenna]]
		1. This actually helps [[Mythological Figures/Saint Brenna\|Saint Brenna]] free up from her wrappings, as they were a bit constricting, and now she is *fully revealed*
	2. [[_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]] and [[_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|I]] attempt our attacks, but we each miss
	3. **RUDELY** ignoring the party, [[Mythological Figures/Saint Brenna\|Saint Brenna]] *Glares* at [[NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Bryce]], freezing him to the spot!
		1. Then, with a ferocity heretofore *UNSEEN* by your intrepid reporter, the corpse freakishly fists the mortified man and punches his person!
	4. [[_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] does a frost on [[Mythological Figures/Saint Brenna\|Saint Brenna]]! She gets a little chilly.
	5. The other knights then showed up, and they flank the [[Mythological Figures/Saint Brenna\|revenant saint]].
	6. [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]], showing spell affinity, smacks [[Mythological Figures/Saint Brenna\|Saint Brenna]] hard **TWICE!**
	7. I creep up behind the mummy to [[NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Bryce]], and give him a restorative touch
	8. [[_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]] attempted to attack the creature, and misses
		1. However, he makes a *critical observation*; [[Mythological Figures/Saint Brenna\|Saint Brenna]] only attacks those who hit her
	9. [[Mythological Figures/Saint Brenna\|Saint Brenna]] lurched over to [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]], got right down in her face, and whispered something horrifying
		1. *No escape...*
		2. [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] is initially terrified, but some mystical force reveals itself through her, and the undead monster is pushed back, and a glow emanates from her body
		3. However, [[Mythological Figures/Saint Brenna\|Saint Brenna]] still gets a fist in, and completely **destroys** [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]]
	10. [[_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] unleashes two *fire bolts*, one of which misses so badly, that [[Mythological Figures/Saint Brenna\|Saint Brenna]] is actually more resistant to attacks from him.
		1. Normally, mummy's are bone dry, but because [[Mythological Figures/Saint Brenna\|Saint Brenna]] is *so wet*, it doesn't do to much
	11. The guards do nothing
	12. [[NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Bryce]], now revived, storms up to [[Mythological Figures/Saint Brenna\|Saint Brenna]] and *strikes her down*
	13. [[_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|I]] revive [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] from her temporary torpor
3. [[NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Bryce]] warns us that touching the corpses could cause them to revivify - **FORESHADOWING**
	1. Is that how [[Mythological Figures/Saint Brenna\|Saint Brenna]] was revived, the *touch* of a knight? Unclear. [[NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Bryce]] evaded the question.
	2. We take a short break, in the tomb, surrounded by corpses. I play for my friends [[Songs and Stories/Path to Mephistopheles\|my new composition]] to ease their minds in this dark place.
		1. Each corpse has two citrine gemstones in their eye sockets, and there is a greatsword with the celestial phrase **twilight** written on the blade
		2. The temptation proves too much for our [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Gnome]] and [[_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Glowborn]] 
4. [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] and [[_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] attempt to loot a corpse, and turns out, we should have listened to [[NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Bryce]] when he said **don't touch the corpses**
	1. Fortunately, the skeletons appear a bit rusty from their deep slumber, and struggle to get a good strike in
	2. [[_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] lands a *thunder wave* against two of the boner- I mean skeletons
	3. [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] attempts to steal another citrine eye, but misses, and instead *caves in the skull* of the skeleton
		1. [[_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|I]] make a mess by throwing holy water everywhere
	4. [[_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] **claps** two skellies to death
	5. [[_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]] *lays to rest the soul of a skeleton* with his new holy sword
	6. Some more murder happened, but I got distracted by [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]]'s [hot ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M4X2_KT1Ss)
5. [[NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Bryce]]'s boys lock us in, giving us 10 minutes to explore further
	1. [[NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Bryce]] himself is not pleased that [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] and [[_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]] disrupted the dead, where [[_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] and [[_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|I]] did absolutely nothing wrong
		1. He did seem peeved about the holy water though...
	2. We move on into the next room, and [[NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Bryce]] attempts to lift the [[Artifacts and Mythic Items/The Scepter of Saint Vitruvio\|The Scepter of Saint Vitruvio]], but is unable to, claiming to hear voices.
		1. [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] swoops in and snaps it up, no problems whatsoever, and she appears to have a conversation with an entity that is not in the room...
	3. [[NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Bryce]] says "This is incredible... [[NPCs/Knight Captain Theodore Marshall\|Knight Captain Theodore Marshall]] must learn of this!" and seems... happy?
		1. Whatever he truly feels, he hides it well...
6. As we begin to leave, we are interrupted by [[Factions/The Followers of the Falling Flame\|The Followers of the Falling Flame]]
	1. They absolutely *dis the shit* out of [[NPCs/Sir Bryce Landry\|Bryce]] as a false faithful of the flame
	2. They ask if we will give [[Artifacts and Mythic Items/The Scepter of Saint Vitruvio\|The Scepter of Saint Vitruvio]] to [[NPCs/Lucretia Methias\|Lucretia Methias]]
7. We return to [[Locations/Emberwood\|Emberwood]], and after the strain of such fighting and wiles, we grow more powerful!
