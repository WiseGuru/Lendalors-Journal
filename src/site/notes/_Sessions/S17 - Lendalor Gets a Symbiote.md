# S17 - Lendalor Gets a Symbiote

[[_Sessions/Missions\|Our current missions.]]

## Session Summary
1. There was some time between S16 and S17, so we were treated to a nice summary and a story from [[NPCs/Kevin Ewidlyr\|Kevin Ewidlyr]]'s history and other tid-bits
	1. [[NPCs/Kreya\|Kreya]] told me to meet with her at the [[Locations/Landmarks/Skull and Sword\|Skull and Sword]] in [[Locations/Emberwood\|Emberwood]]
	2. [[Mythological Figures/The Queen of Thieves\|The Queen of Thieves]] wants to recruit [[NPCs/Oscar Yoren\|Oscar Yoren]] to work for her, where he currently works for [[Factions/The Hooded Lanterns\|The Hooded Lanterns]]
		1. This is interesting, because in [[_Sessions/S10 - Meeting the Tiger Monarch\|S10 - Meeting the Tiger Monarch]], [[NPCs/Rehani Miblepebble\|Rehani Miblepebble]] said he probably already worked for [[Mythological Figures/The Queen of Thieves\|The Queen of Thieves]]...
2. We return to [[Locations/Emberwood\|Emberwood]]
	1. [[_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] gets 400GP from the [[Locations/Landmarks/Eventide Manner\|Eventide Manner]] traps and 3 or 4 health potions
		1. Also a golden cloth... unclear on selling and cost, but it's going toward upkeep of the manor.
	2. [[_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|I]] meet up with [[NPCs/Kreya\|Kreya]] in the [[Locations/Landmarks/Skull and Sword\|Skull and Sword]]^[I convinced [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] and [[_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]] come along, and they hang out with [[Gurog\|Gurog]], but I guess they were just listening in and not a ton happened.]
		1. She is a member of [[History/Orc Tribes/The Danaus Nation\|The Danaus Nation]]
			1. They are not worshippers of the outsider gods; they are [[Factions/Defiers\|Defiers]]
				1. There are three levels; Dissenters, Heretics, and Iconoclasts
				2. She is a Heretic, and has been one for many years
		2. [[Mythological Figures/Infirmum\|Infirmum]] is considered an "easier" outsider to defy
		3. When one takes on a challenge by the gods, they can become corrupted
			1. Similarly, [[NPCs/Kreya\|Kreya]] believes that symbiotes others have gained in [[Locations/Drakkenheim\|Drakkenheim]] were already corrupted
				1. The ones we see are maybe not of pure [[Mythological Figures/Infirmum\|Infirmum]], but something else trying to assume control
		4. Symbiotes take on different forms, depending on where it is latched
			1. Spine worms
				1. Basically functions as a clumsy set of helping hands
			2. The Gibbering Limb
				1. Replaces one of your limbs with the symbiote, making the host stronger
			3. Widow's Blades
				1. Like [[NPCs/Kreya\|Kreya]]'s, form tremendous boney wings that enhance mobility
		5. After due consideration (and a couple questions), [[_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|I]] decide to take on a [[Creatures/Symbiote\|Symbiote]] and pursue a challenge!
3. We leave [[Locations/Emberwood\|Emberwood]] and head for [[NPCs/Reed Manor\|Reed Manor]], and en route, fight a Chimera
	1. The terrifying beast tried to stalk us from the roof tops, but [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] spotted it
		1. I was too distracted with the aches and pains of my recent grafting to notice
	2. It swooped in and blew its firey breath upon us, dropping [[_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]] and almost knocking down [[_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]]
		1. I healed [[_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]] and moved so as to be out of the way of another breath attack
	3. [[NPCs/Dolgroth\|Dolgroth]] stared it down with his *Dreadful Glare*, and it was both too hungry to leave us, but to frightened to advance
		1. In turns, we cast spells and struck at it, until it eventually turned tail and fled. 
4. We reach [[NPCs/Reed Manor\|Reed Manor]]
	1. Out front we run into [[NPCs/Petra Lang\|Petra Lang]], member of [[Factions/The Hooded Lanterns\|The Hooded Lanterns]]
	2. [[NPCs/Oscar Yoren\|Oscar Yoren]] has locked himself away, is rambling, and may be in trouble.
		1. If he wasn't before we arrived, he may be after...
