[[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]], being the very capable fence and merchant she is, handled the sale of all the gear we collected, and we bought a couple health potions from [[NPCs/Aldor the Immense\|Aldor]]. I tried to haggle him down a little, but instead he STARED INTO MY SOUL, and I don't know how I feel about that.

I asked around to learn about the various groups, and learned about the thugs whose cache we raided in [[_Sessions/S01 - Follow the Octarine Brick Road\|S1]]
- [[NPCs/Blackjack Mel\|Blackjack Mel]] is a member of [[Factions/The Queen's Men\|The Queen's Men]], and he hangs around the [[Locations/Emberwood\|Bark and Buzzard]]

[[_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] dipped out of view, and later we found out he checked in to his home at [[Locations/Emberwood\|Eventide Manner]], and we meet the delightful [[NPCs/Lukrum Stormrock\|Lukrum]]

[[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] went to speak with her parents, who are very cute and sweet. Also, [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] has a brother named Kevin who's been brainwashed by thugs?!?

Once the day was done, we all had a slumber party at [[Locations/Emberwood\|Eventide Manner]] and [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] made pancakes in the morning. I wrote a short update to [[Factions/The Pail Sifter\|The Pail Sifter]] and sent it on its way.

[[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] and [[_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]] are approached by a man in a green hood, [[NPCs/Ansem Lang\|Ansem Lang]], who informed them that his sister [[NPCs/Petra Lang\|Petra Lang]] was kidnapped by [[Creatures/Ratlings\|Ratlings]]
- it's about 3 miles out of [[Locations/Emberwood\|Emberwood]], but we should be able to get there today

We embarked on our quest to rescue [[NPCs/Petra Lang\|Petra Lang]]!
- We first encountered a female gnome member of [[Factions/The Amethyst Academy\|The Amethyst Academy]], and after some cautious exchanges of the Message spell, we discovered she is my old friend [[NPCs/Rehani Miblepebble\|Rehani Miblepebble]]!
	- Always a much better student than me, no doubt she's doing well in [[Factions/The Amethyst Academy\|The Amethyst Academy]].
	- When she learned we're headed to the [[Locations/Landmarks/Rat's Nest Tavern\|Rat's Nest Tavern]], she offered us 1200GP for a crystal of [[Artifacts and Mythic Items/Delirium\|Delirium]]that's rumored to be there.
	- She's staying at [[Locations/Emberwood\|The Red Line Inn]], and we can meet up with her there to trade.
- [[_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]] observes this crazy balista-looking thing, and it's a crazy-dangerous gnome contraption; an [[Artifacts and Mythic Items/Oaken Bolter\|Oaken Bolter]]
