### Special Race Info:  

**Aasimar, Tieflings, and Gnomes Origin**:

This land is set in a different dimension than Soland, The Feywild. It is home to a number of creatures, including gnomes, Glowborne, and Dusklords, who are in a constant war with one another. The two main source of the war is between The Luminous Court and The Eventide Empire.

   **Aasimar**: Known as Glowborne in the Feywild, these people are typically very physically beautiful. They mostly resemble humans but have various characteristics of more angelic figures. Glowing skin and/hair, halos, starkly colored hair, metallic colored eyes, etc. Glowborne who come to Soland often find jobs as models or diplomats, but stereotypes persist of them being master manipulators. The Luminous Court, their home kingdom, uses underhanded tactics and subterfuge to fight against The Eventide Empire. The Glowborne are more known for being casters (sorcerer, bard) rather than warriors, but the fighters among them usually do incorporate magic into their combat (eldritch knight, paladin, warlock).

  

   **Tiefling**: Known as Dusklords in the Feywild, these people are more intimidating than their counterparts. They resemble humans but with more drastic changes. Horns, tails, solid eyes, and sometimes scaly skin, these can also resemble the demons and devils of Soland. Dusklords in Soland are a little more rare in larger cities, as they are more typically found in rougher lands where mercenary work can be found. The Eventide Empire is more strict with who it lets in and out of its kingdom, often setting bounties for those that escape their grasp. The Dusklords are more known for being warriors than casters (fighter, ranger, barbarian) rather than casters, but they still seek to be masters of whatever they pursue, even if it is magic (Wizard, cleric, paladin)

  

   **Gnome**: Gnomes are given many names by the other two races of the Feywild, but the one they typically agree on is Glims. Gnomes, or Glims, were once the self proclaimed "Kings" of the Feywild, and kept the ancestors of Dusklords and Glowbornes as slaves. A few hundred years ago, however, they were toppled by an uprising that was led by two figures who would become known as The Mothers, who split their followers into Glowborne and Dusklords, starting the two kingdoms. Ever since, the gnomes have been captured and forced into slavery. Gnomes had found a way out of the Feywild and sought refuge in Soland in Delmarva, claiming it as their new homeland for all refugees. Bounties are still put out on all those that escape the Feywild, however, and many always seem to find themselves dragged back to the Feywild as a result.

  

**Hobgoblins Origin**:

   Hobgoblins are a brand new race to Soland, and very little is known about them other than they are ruthless and cunning natural fighters.. Rumors swirl constantly about how they came about, the older ones showing scars that could only be made by surgery. They made Delmarva their home after becoming known to the world. With the destruction of Drakkenhiem, however, they seemed to have rallied together to take back the land that they tried to call home.

  

## Potential Backgrounds:  

**Apocalyptic Vision**. I have been haunted by visions of the explosion for fifteen years. Every time I sleep, I see it crashing down upon me. My personal quest is to see for myself what lies at the heart of the crater. I must overcome whatever I find there in order to stop these nightmares.

**Arcane Secrets**. Forbidden lore lies in Drakkenheim. Several dark wizards living in the ruins have mastered terrible and powerful new magic. The Inscrutable Tower library stands unguarded, filled with spellbooks containing secret arcana. My personal quest is to learn these spells.  

**Blighted Landscape**. A blight on the natural order envelops Drakkenheim, but the contamination could spread beyond the city. My personal quest is to study the unnatural phenomena found within the most corrupt places in the city: Queen’s Park Garden, the underground waterways, and the Crater’s Edge. Perhaps then I can develop a way to reverse the contamination.  
  
**Claim the Throne**. Though my family has fallen on hard times, we were distantly related to the royal House von Kessel. I may have a claim to the throne of Drakkenheim. My personal quest is to search the cathedral, noble estates, and the castle for sufficient evidence to conclusively prove my inheritance. Then I will take the crown for myself.  
  
**Faction Aspirant**. I believe strongly in the ideals and goals of one of the five factions: either the Amethyst Academy, the Followers of the Falling Fire, the Hooded Lanterns, the Drakken Guard, or the Queen’s Men. My personal quest is to join the faction, aid their mission, climb the ranks, and rise to a high leadership position within their organization.  
  
**Family Matter**. One of my family members or close friends has become mixed up with one of the factions. Perhaps they have foolishly decided to join the organization. Alternatively, they’ve been taken prisoner by the faction due to some trespass or misunderstanding. Either way, my personal quest is to bring them back home.  
  
**Find a Cure**. I have a friend, family member, or loved one who was contaminated by delerium and turned into a monster. They have gone mad, and are lost somewhere in Drakkenheim. My personal quest is to locate them, then discover a way to reverse their horrific transformation.  
  
**Lost Heirloom**. I used to live in Drakkenheim. My personal quest is to recover a lost heirloom from my old home, which was located somewhere in the Inner City. Perhaps the item is sentimental, valuable only to members of my family. Alternatively it may have magical properties, and I wish to use these powers to aid my own ambitions.  
  
**Monster Slayer**. I wish to leave behind a heroic legacy by defeating dread beasts. My personal quest is to slay three of the greatest monsters rumoured to dwell in Drakkenheim, and bring back their heads as trophies. Each must be a notable creature with a challenge rating greater than my own level when I defeat them. My allies can assist me, but I must strike the decisive blow myself!  
  
**Overwhelming Debt**. I owe a tremendous debt of 10,000 gold pieces, maybe more. My personal quest is to pay it back by making a fortune in Drakkenheim collecting delerium, plunder, and completing work-for-hire. Meanwhile, I must hide from bounty hunters my creditor send to kill me.  
  
**Personal Pilgrimage**. As an acolyte of the faith, my personal quest is to visit several holy places in the city and perform a sacred ritual before the remains of the martyrs interred within each: the [[Locations/Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio\|Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio]], Saint Selina’s Monastery, and the Chapel in Castle Drakken. Through these devoted acts I will understand my place in the divine order.

# 3. A History of Drakkenheim: From Glory to Ruin

In the annals of Delmarva's storied past, no city stands as a more striking testament to both the heights of mortal ambition and the depths of catastrophic despair than Drakkenheim. Once the proud capital of Delmarva, Drakkenheim's history is a tapestry woven with threads of magic, ambition, and the inexorable march of time.

## More Correct History of Drakkenheim
### **The Rise of Drakkenheim**

In the early days of Delmarva's exploration, this rugged continent was home to many dangers, but it was also a land of great magic. Ancient forests teemed with mystical creatures, and arcane energies flowed like rivers. Delmarva was a place of both healing and peril, where those seeking its magical bounty were as likely to be mended as maimed by the land's otherworldly forces.

It was against this backdrop that the Drakken Guard, an order of skilled elves and humans, emerged. Their primary duty was to protect the world from the creatures that lurked beyond Delmarva's shores. As Delmarva became more well-known, it attracted people from far and wide, both those seeking its magic for good and those with darker intentions.

### **The Founding of Drakkenheim**

As explorers and settlers came to Delmarva, they found the land inhospitable and harsh. It was the Drakken Guard who offered protection and sanctuary within the walls of a burgeoning city, which they named Drakkenheim. Over time, Drakkenheim grew into a thriving metropolis, and it was unique in its relationship with the ancient order. [[Factions/The Drakken Guard\|The Drakken Guard]] began to focus not only on protecting the continent but also on healing those who were beyond the abilities of common healers.

As the city prospered, it attracted powerful wizards, scholars, and adventurers. Drakkenheim soon became a center of magical learning and research. [[Factions/The Amethyst Academy\|The Amethyst Academy]] was founded, dedicated to the study of abjuration, enchantment, and divination, and it attracted some of the brightest minds from across the realms.

### **The Reign of the Von Kessels**

Drakkenheim's history took a significant turn when the Von Kessel family rose to power. Led by King Ulrich and Queen Lenore, they were beloved by the people and strengthened the kingdom's ties to other realms through trade and diplomacy. King Ulrich, in particular, was known for his wisdom and vision.

The Von Kessels had three children: Leonard, Katarina, and Eliza. Their family was related to the first human who joined the Drakken Guard, solidifying their connection to the order. Drakkenheim's prosperity continued under their rule, and it became a beacon of civilization in the otherwise untamed continent of Delmarva.

### **The Catastrophe**

Then came the night that forever changed Drakkenheim's fate. An explosion of eldritch fire erupted within the city, bathing it in a sickly and ominous light. The cataclysmic event tore through the very heart of Drakkenheim, causing devastation beyond measure. Families were torn asunder, the kingdom shattered, and the once-majestic city was reduced to ruins.

The explosion had a far-reaching impact. Monsters and abominations now stalked the haunted streets of Drakkenheim. Rival factions emerged from the ashes, each vying for control over the city's few remaining resources and the dark secrets hidden within its crumbling walls.

### **The Legacy Continues**

Fifteen years after the catastrophe, Drakkenheim is a city in ruins, its former glory but a distant memory. The factions that emerged from the chaos now vie for control, and adventurers from near and far are drawn to the haunted streets in search of riches, renown, and revenge.
