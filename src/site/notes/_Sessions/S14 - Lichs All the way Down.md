(in brief, as I'm in a rush)
## Session Summary
1. We begin again, and this time, we go for broke
	1. [[_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] distracts the patrons of the bar with Dancing Lights, [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] shoots [[NPCs/Miss Charlotte\|Miss Charlotte]] in the face with a crossbow, and [[Osiris\|Osiris]] destroys the piano with a Cone of Frost
	2. We rescue a hooded lantern guy
2. We go down stairs and talk with the card sharks, and I use Suggestion to make one of the parasites less aggressive, and allows us to have a conversation
	1. [[Factions/Infirmum's Chosen\|Infirmum's Chosen]]
		1. [[Items of Interest/Heinrich's Orders\|Heinrich's Orders]]
			1. “One of the wizards from the AA has offered us a trade, she is the apprentice of Dolgroth, we have an in. Meet her at the clocktower.”
3. We go in and absolutely destroy the monster
	1. As the monster dies, the inn fades into the true decay and wreckage of its current state
4. [[NPCs/Dolgroth\|Dolgroth]] kept talking to the card sharks with the parasites, and he helps me find a jar with a partially decayed [[Creatures/Spine Worm\|parasite]]
	1. *Still alive; appears to be an external [[Creatures/Spine Worm\|Spine Worm]], not the one that gives strength*
5. We also find 2 fragments of Delerium and a chunk of meteoric iron
6. The other recent patrons (Balthazar, etc.) are alive, but everyone else is ash.
