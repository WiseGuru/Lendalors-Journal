# S13 - Kevin Discovered

[[_Sessions/Missions\|Our current missions.]]

## Session Summary
1. The [[Locations/Landmarks/Black Ivory Inn\|Black Ivory Inn]] is more than it seems...
	1. [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] inspects [[NPCs/Kevin Ewidlyr\|Kevin Ewidlyr]]'s head.
		1. Got nothing
	2. [[_Players/Echo Starcaller\|Echo]] inspects the building, and senses that it's a highly magical construction
	3. [[_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|I]] accompany [[Miss Charlotte\|Miss Charlotte]] in her performance of [Ein Prosit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdHxMkklvDI)
		1. Here's how she's playing: [Ein Prosit - Piano Improv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUPcUc4xN6g&t=19s)
2. The ground rumbles, and we look outside; the city of Drakkenheim is there!
	1. It erupts in a massive explosion
	2. A giant piece of [[Artifacts and Mythic Items/Delirium\|Delirium]] whistles through the air and pierces [[Miss Charlotte\|Miss Charlotte]]
	3. We blink, and we are back outside the inn
3. Memory problems
	1. [[_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|I]] drank some of the ale they were serving, and we re-awoke outside of the inn, I didn't know my own comrades!
	2. Fortunately, my memory was restored, and we made plans...
4. We looped two more times, and this is what we learned:
	1. Abilities are reset on a loop, but dying introduces madness and eating or drinking from the [[Locations/Landmarks/Black Ivory Inn\|Black Ivory Inn]] causes memory problems
	2. [[Miss Charlotte\|Miss Charlotte]]
		1. The drakkenguard at the front is very protective of [[Miss Charlotte\|Miss Charlotte]]
		2. [[Miss Charlotte\|Miss Charlotte]] has magical power, and was able to dispel a firebolt
		3. [["Open" Mike Connolly\|"Open" Mike Connolly]] is in love with [[Miss Charlotte\|Miss Charlotte]], and knows a secret about how she gained her powers
			1. Claims he told her? That she was spoken to by an angel? Something?
		4. We cannot prevent the [[Artifacts and Mythic Items/Delirium\|Delirium]] from hitting [[Miss Charlotte\|Miss Charlotte]]
		5. [[Miss Charlotte\|Miss Charlotte]] is linked somehow to a flesh-beast in the basement
			1. The flesh-beast is similar in nature to the mind-speaking building we passed earlier
	3. There is a guy upstairs who is out of the timeloop, but believes it's the end times
	4. The gangsters downstairs are controlled by parasites
		1. We heard the names [[Heinrich\|Heinrich]] and [[Choroba\|Choroba]] before we entered the room
	5. We were able to revive [[NPCs/Kevin Ewidlyr\|Kevin Ewidlyr]], who now remembers [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]], and a man from the [[Factions/The Amethyst Academy\|The Amethyst Academy]] named [[Osiris\|Osiris]]
5. Hypotheses:
	1. [[Miss Charlotte\|Miss Charlotte]] was possibly granted a *Wish* to be the greatest pianist in the world, and the [[Artifacts and Mythic Items/Delirium\|Delirium]] that hit her had an interaction
	2. The [[Locations/Landmarks/Black Ivory Inn\|Black Ivory Inn]] and [[Miss Charlotte\|Miss Charlotte]] are basically just lures for the flesh-beast in the basement
6. In the last loop, [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] was killed by a flesh-beast in the basement, and awoke with madness in her eyes...
