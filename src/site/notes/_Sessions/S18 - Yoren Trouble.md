# S18 - Yoren Trouble

[[_Sessions/Missions\|Our current missions.]]

## Session Summary
1. We talk with [[NPCs/Petra Lang\|Petra]] a bit, and discuss ways to get in.
	1. She's observed at least two apprentices of [[NPCs/Oscar Yoren\|Oscar Yoren]] moving within the building, and two rotted-out doors are around back.
	2. The manor is also guarded by cloaked **Chekhov's Zombie Ogres**, and one of them spots us
		1. He comes over to tell us to bugger off, but [[_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|I]] use my wit and charm to bluff our way into the manor^[We are health inspecters coming from the city coming to ensure that the potions are being manufactured to industry standards and meet certain criteria for saftery.]
	3. Inside, we are greeted by an elven woman named [[Gemma\|Gemma]], and I tell her that we're here doing a standard health checkup on [[NPCs/Oscar Yoren\|Mr. Yoren]] and that we must meet with him to ensure his safety.
		2. We push past her, she panics, and leaves to speak with a guy named [[Marco\|Marco]] in the other room. 
		3. [[_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] chats with a familiar cat, and learns that [[NPCs/Oscar Yoren\|Oscar Yoren]] is in the basement
		4. [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] overhears [[Gemma\|Gemma]] and [[Marco\|Marco]] discussing us, and she hears [[Marco\|Marco]] use a secret door to look get the old wizard.
		5. [[NPCs/Petra Lang\|Petra]] is also there.
2. [[NPCs/Oscar Yoren\|Oscar Yoren]] comes in, and I tell him it's time for a health inspection and begin walking him through various exercises to gauge his fitness
	1. He goes with it for a moment, then gets flustered.
	2. [[NPCs/Petra Lang\|Petra]] talks with him for a moment, and while they're distracted, I slip outside and climb in through a back window into another room and start looking for the secret door.
3. [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] realizes that the [[NPCs/Oscar Yoren\|Oscar Yoren]] we've been speaking with is a fake, and she stabs him in the stomach!
	1. The fake Oscar turns out to be [[Marco\|Marco]], and while everyone starts fighting, [[_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|I]] keep looking for the secret door.
	2. [[_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] kills [[Marco\|Marco]] with a *Firebolt*, and [[Gemma\|Gemma]] runs outside to get backup from the zombie ogres
	3. [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] goes all in chasing after them, and gets hit hard by one of the ogres
	4. [[NPCs/Dolgroth\|Dolgroth]] finds a book of sexy skulls, which coincidentally opens the secret door to the basement
	5. I descend, find [[NPCs/Oscar Yoren\|Oscar Yoren]], and we reach a truce.
