[[_Sessions/Missions\|Our current missions.]]

## Session Summary
- The strange howl turned out to be some weird transmogrified Bullywog-frog people!
	- They attacked with alacrity, and we endeavored to fight them off
	- With great leaps,^[[[Echo Starcaller\|Echo]], we really needed them on our track and field team] they closed the distance and attacked with vicious spears
	- [[_Players/Weela Ewidlyr\|Weela]] did much work, but with [[_Players/Argoth Calamenthe\|Argoth]] frequently stealing the kills
- We rescue the survivors, and one of them is [[NPCs/Nathaniel Flint\|Nathaniel]]
	- He tells us that the more human-like creatures are actually [[Creatures/Delirium Dregs\|dregs]]
	- We convince him that we're here documenting their journey
	- We take him with us on our journey on...
- We stop at [[Champion's Gate\|Champion's Gate]], where [[Factions/The Followers of the Falling Flame\|The Followers of the Falling Flame]] have setup a kind of camp/stopping point for their pilgrimage
	- [[NPCs/Lucretia Methias\|Lucretia Methias]] is at [[St. Selena's Monastery\|St. Selena's Monastery]]
	- [[_Players/Lendalor Thugijak\|I]] interviewed [[NPCs/Nathaniel Flint\|Nathaniel]] about the [[Factions/The Followers of the Falling Flame\|Falling Flame]]...
		- The pilgrimage is a personal journey of determination
		- Those brave enough to reach the crater and return are blessed, coming out healthier with the [[Artifacts and Mythic Items/Delirium\|Delirium]]
			- However, it is a lethal journey.
			- It all frankly reminds me of the [[Mythological Figures/Orcish Pantheon\|Orcish Pantheon]]
			- The [[Artifacts and Mythic Items/Delirium\|Delirium]] crystals puncture their hearts, and an *octarine* light can sometimes be seen emanating from the "successful" pilgrims
		- The more overcome someone is with contamination, the more likely they are to have a vision
- We decide to press on in search of [[NPCs/Kevin Ewidlyr\|Kevin Ewidlyr]], heading up to the [[Locations/Landmarks/Black Ivory Inn\|Black Ivory Inn]]
