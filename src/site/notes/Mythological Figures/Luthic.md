Vivid description: 
- By contrast, the Orcish interpretation of [[Mythological Figures/Luthic\|Luthic]] is a lower-tier Divine God of healing. She is perceived as an unfortunate necessity, either the consequences of failure. She doesn't test the will of orcs like the others do, but heals them if they fail but are not killed.
