The orcish pantheon is their interpretation/perception of the *[Outsiders](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gjJxIf0RvnLmZNSnYQ6s4wp-SPVA0mM8zl7yfzQxToU/edit#heading=h.emh1o8fc6o5j)*, evil pseudo-gods that are the embodiment of concepts like [[Mythological Figures/Entropus\|chaos]], [[Mythological Figures/Radsla\|fear]], [[Mythological Figures/Infirmum\|disease]], [[Mythological Figures/Telis\|undeath/necromancy]], [[Mythological Figures/Nimic\|hate]], and [[Mythological Figures/Hadnost\|greed]].

However, instead of worshipping these entities in a traditional way, they **endure** them through trials and challenges. Enduring the tests of the Outsiders is something that many orc tribes seek to do. If you can endure your biggest fear, or give away all possessions, or survive a disease, etc., then you are considered enlightened or ascendant. 

The harder the test, the more fame you have to win or lose
